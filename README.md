## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

1. **dotenv** ‚Äì Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, simplifying access to API keys and other secrets.

2. **Streamlit** ‚Äì A Python library for creating interactive web applications with minimal code. Here, it‚Äôs used to build the SmartParse UI for uploading and interacting with PDF files.

3. **ChatGroq (with `ChatGroq` model)** ‚Äì A conversational model setup for SmartParse, providing natural language generation for responding to user queries on PDF content.

4. **PyPDF2** ‚Äì A Python library for reading and extracting text from PDF files, which enables text processing within SmartParse.

5. **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** ‚Äì Splits long text into manageable chunks, allowing efficient processing and retrieval, especially useful for handling large PDF documents.

6. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** ‚Äì A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used here for storing and retrieving vectorized text data.

7. **Hugging Face Embeddings** ‚Äì The "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model generates sentence embeddings, enabling semantic similarity between user queries and PDF content.

8. **Chroma** ‚Äì A vector store framework, allowing fast and efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. In this case, it‚Äôs used to store and retrieve chunks of text from the PDF.

9. **ChatMessageHistory** ‚Äì A component to store chat message history, preserving context in conversations, especially valuable for continuous queries.

10. **ConversationBufferMemory** ‚Äì A memory object that retains chat history for ongoing conversation context, essential for generating contextually relevant responses.

11. **ConversationalRetrievalChain** ‚Äì Combines language models with retrieval mechanisms, allowing users to ask questions based on retrieved document information, providing accurate and context-aware answers.
